# Piano.JS

A basic piano synth, using University of Iowa public domain samples, implemented in CSS/JS.

See: https://ccarpita.github.io/piano-js/

Only Chrome/Firefox/Edge is supported, Safari 10+ should work once 2016 MacOS is out of beta.

## TODO

- Investigate integration of UIOWA samples with MIDI.js, remove unused boilerplate
- Package for distribution, download sound-font as postinstall
- Better browser support with Babel
